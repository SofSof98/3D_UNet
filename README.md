# Convolutional Neural Networks for Automatic Segmentation of Intraprostatic Cancer Lesions 

Master's Degree Thesis in Bioninformatics for Computational Genomics with a project focusing on the development of convolutional neural networks for automatic segmentation of intraprostatic cancer lesions on 68Ga-PSMA PET Images. In this repository you can find the code used for the experiments performed and described in the project.
