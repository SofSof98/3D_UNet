# Convolutional Neural Networks for Automatic Segmentation of Intraprostatic Cancer Lesions 

Master's Degree Thesis in Bioninformatics for Computational Genomics with a project focusing on the development of convolutional neural networks for automatic segmentation of intraprostatic cancer lesions on $$^{68}$$Ga-PSMA PET Images. The project was carried out in collaboration with the Department of Nuclear Medicine of the IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute.

In this repository you can find the code used for the experiments performed and described in the project.
